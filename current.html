  <h1>Personal</h1>
  <p>Howdy! As said before, my name is Maggie von Ebers, I'm a sophomore computer science major, and I am the loudest and the proudest member of the fighting Texas Aggies Class of 2020 AY-AY-AY-AY!<br><br>
	  I'm Des Moines, Iowa born and raised, though I have also lived in Rochester, New York and Fargo, North Dakota (where I now live when not at school). I have no connections whatsoever to Texas, but I was drawn to Aggieland's collaborative spirit, traditions, and of course the football games! <br><br>
	  When I'm not working on a coding project or homework, you can find me reading, sketching, or riding horses. I love being an equestrian so much that I've ridden competitively at events across the nation for over ten years. When I moved from New York to North Dakota, I found that there was no competition scene there. Thanks to online classes and plenty of saved frequent-flier miles I was able to fly back and forth from ND to my horse and trainer in NY; I did this for all four years of highschool. <br><br>
	  This time spent traveling is what I think gave me my start in computer science. On airplanes you can't access much of the internet, so I began to dig through Windows' file systems and gain a curiousity for all that went on beneath the GUI. After I found this love, I was lucky enough to be accepted to Stanford's Pre-Collegiate program studying Artificial Intelligence. That's when I knew I couldn't do anything else with my life!<br><br>
  These days my main focus and interest is in machine learning and natural language processing, though I'd like to see what else the underlying theory can apply to.</p>
