<a href="https://x.com/NeelNanda5/status/1840157904835338526">blog</a>, 
so I started a blog. Actually, I’ve been sitting on this for about a year,
threatening to myself to do it every 2 weeks or so, which might be a little bit
more embarrassing.</p>

<p>I just graduated from my master’s degree, which was a difficult process for me
for a number of reasons that I might write about later. One lesson that it
taught me, that I’ll forever be thankful for, is that nothing could be better
for your brain than putting your thoughts into some real-life format. To-dos
need to be written down to get done. Research ideas need to be torn apart by
your professor to become viable. Dissatisfaction with your life, or even
just natural latent energy, needs to be turned into a sport or writing or
relationships or lasting change, or it’ll become rumination and worse.</p>

<p>So I’m going to start writing about research topics that I think are cool. I
have no idea if they’ll be worthwhile or readable for a long time, but I’m going to
keep posting and posting until I’m 85 years old and I produce a singular
beautiful contribution to the field of mechanistic interpretability. You should
probably follow along so you don’t miss it.</p>

<h1 id="the-content-though">The content, though?</h1>

<p>I read a lot of papers for my degree (which is computational neuroscience)
and I want to talk about them. They’re mostly about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cognitive maps</li>
  <li>place cells and grid cells</li>
  <li>continual learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this is a cool niche that people will be interested in, and one day
I’ll write up something about my thesis as well.</p>]]></content><author><name>Maggie von Ebers</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regina George Neel Nanda started a blog, so I started a blog.
