<p>
Hey! I'm a first year Masters in Computer Science student interested in
Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Science. I previously worked as a SWE
for Dell for two years, and before that I have some very basic ML
experience. 

<p>
Here is my undergrad paper for ACM ICMI 2020: <a href="hubbs-paper.pdf"
download="Paper">click</a>

<p>
Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

<p>
(1) Modelling cognitive disorders

<p>
(2) Lifelong learning

<p>
(3) Neural Turing Machines / Differentiable Neural Computers 

<p>

However, I am very flexible when it comes to cognitive science/computational
neuroscience topics.

<p>
I have not yet teamed up with anyone.
